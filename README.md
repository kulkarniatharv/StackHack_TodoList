## To use frontend
1. Clone the frontend branch locally.
1. Open a terminal and change it's path to the directory you cloned this repo.

1. Type `npm start` to start the server.

### To commit to any branch:
1. Pull the changes first before committing.
1. Check for any conflict.
1. **DO NOT** upload `node_modules`.
